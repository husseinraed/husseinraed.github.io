**`Q1) What is Computer Architecture ?`**

```yaml
Ans: Computer Architecture is a science or a set of rules stating
computer software and hardware are joined together 

and interact to make a computer work. 

In short, computer architecture refers to how a computer system is
designed and what technologies it is compatible with
```

**`Q2) Describe the main functions of CPU ?`**

```yaml
Ans: Accept instructions and data from the input unit.

store all the data and instructions in memory.

Execute instructions and send commands to relevant units.

Perform all the arthmetic and logical operations in ALU.

controls and coordinates the activities of all other units.
```

**`Q3) What is a fetch execute cycle ?`**

```yaml
Ans: An instruction cycle, sometimes called a fetch-decode execute
cycle is the basic process

by wich a computer retrieves a program instructions from its memory,

determines what actions the instructions dictates, and carries out
those actions
```

**`Q4) Write A note on computer memory`** 

```yaml
Ans: Computers have their own filling system also known as memory
which is internal circuitry where programs and data are stored. 
There are two types of memory.
  1- RAM (Random Access Memory)
  2- ROM (Read Only Memory)
```

**`Q5) What are the types of RAM ?`**

```yaml
Ans: Basically there are two types of RAM and both are volatile
  1- Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
  2- Static RAM (SRAM)
```

**`Q6) What are the types of ROM ?`**

```yaml
Ans: Basically there are two types of ROM and both are
non-volatile
  1- Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM)
  2- Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM)
```

**`Q7) What is Cache Memory ?`**

```yaml
Ans: Cache Memory is faster than Main Memory,

but slower than CPU and its registers.

Cache Memory wich is normally small in size is placed between the CPU and Main Memory
```

**`Q8) What is Virtual Memory ?`**

```yaml
Ans: Virtual Memory is a section of volatile memory,

created temporarily on the storage drive.

it is created when the computer is running many processes at once.

and ram is running low.
```

**`Q9) What are the types of computer busses ?`**

```yaml
Ans: Computers have three major types of busses
  1- The Address Bus
  2- The Data Bus
  3- The Control Bus
```
